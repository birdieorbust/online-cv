career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        I'm a tech-savvy data enthusiast with a knack for turning numbers into narratives that drive real-world impact. Over the past 10 years, I've been on a mission to help companies unlock the true potential of their data—whether that's in e-commerce, price comparison platforms, or the fast-paced world of financial services.
        These days, I lead a brilliant team at OnBuy.com, where we manage everything from cloud data infrastructure to advanced analytics and data science. I wear multiple hats: part team leader, part hands-on builder. Beyond guiding strategy, I'm deeply involved in creating powerful data products, spearheading the use of AI and large language models to supercharge operations.
        In short: I love data, I love solving problems, and I thrive at the intersection of people, platforms, and possibility.
